            Web development bootcamps typically take about 3-4 months to complete and teach HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Full-stack bootcamps may also teach SQL, Python, or other back-end coding languages. Coding bootcamps typically also cost less than a four-year degree program, but there is little financial aid available.Web development bootcamps typically take about 3-4 months to complete and teach HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
